## Description

**BetterBuilding** is a small mod I made in order to help users build their creations. It is **fully clientside**, meaning you can use it on **Vanilla or Modded** servers without issue.

To download it, you can either download it on this page and put the mod in your `/StarMade/mods` folder, or you can download it using the in game mod downloader available via the main menu (Mods → Browse).

Be sure the mod is marked as enabled in the Mods menu before using it. Happy building!

## Features

- Ability to save and load build hotbars in creative mode by holding down Left Alt and using the Scroll Wheel or Number Keys to select a hotbar. You can have up to 10 saved build hotbars, and the system works near identically to the weapon hotbar system.
- Ability to offset template placements while in paste mode by holding down Left Alt and using the Scroll Wheel or Arrow Keys to change it’s offset. This system also compensates for the direction and orientation of the camera relative to the entity currently being edited. This feature doesn’t require the player to be in creative mode, unlike the build hotbars.
    - The Scroll Wheel option moves templates towards or away from the camera depending on whichever axis is closest to the camera’s facing direction.
    - The Up and Down Arrow keys work similar to the scroll wheel, but you can also use the Left, Right, Page Up, and Page Down keys to move the template in other directions.

## Configuration

- `global-hotbars`: If enabled, hotbars will be saved globally instead of by world / server.

## Future Plans

- More shape build helpers, and improvements / fixes to the existing ones.
- Option to cut paste instead of copy paste.

If you want to suggest a feature, leave a comment on this page, and I’ll look into it.
